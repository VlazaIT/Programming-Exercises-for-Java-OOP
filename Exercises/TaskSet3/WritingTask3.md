 I understand that it's meant to ensure there's only one instance of a class. The key here is the private constructor. By making the constructor private, it stops other parts of the program from creating new instances of the class with the new keyword. Instead, the Singleton class has a special method (usually called getInstance) that checks if an instance already exists. If it doesn't, it creates one; if it does, it just returns the existing one. This way, the class itself controls how and when its instance is created, ensuring that there's only ever one instance throughout the program. This is important because the whole idea of a Singleton is to have a single, shared resource that different parts of the program can use without accidentally creating multiple, potentially conflicting instances.
