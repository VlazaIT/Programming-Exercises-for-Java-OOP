Task 1. Meaning and Characterization of Performance Measures in a Health Centre Context:

- **A (Arrived Clients Count)**: This measures the number of patients who arrive at the health centre. It's a direct count of demand for services.
- **C (Clients Serviced Count)**: Indicates the number of patients who have been treated or serviced, showing the health centre's capacity to meet demand.
- **B (Active Time in Service Point)**: This represents the time doctors or nurses spend actively treating patients, reflecting efficiency and workload.
- **T (Total Simulation Time)**: The overall period under consideration for the simulation, used as a basis for calculating other metrics.
- **U (Service Point Utilization)**: This ratio (B/T) shows how much of the total time the service points (like doctors or diagnostic machines) are actively in use, indicating efficiency and potential overuse.
- **X (Service Throughput)**: The number of patients treated per unit of time (C/T), showing the effectiveness of the health centre.
- **S (Service Time)**: Average time spent on each patient (B/C), a critical factor in patient satisfaction and service quality.
- **Ri (Individual Response Time)**: The time from a patient's arrival to the end of their service. It's important for understanding patient experience.
- **W (Waiting Time)**: Total of all patients' waiting times, a key indicator of service accessibility and efficiency.
- **R (Average Response Time)**: The average time patients spend in the system (W/C), reflecting overall service speed.
- **N (Average Queue Length)**: Represents the average number of patients waiting for service (W/T), indicating the load on the health centre.

Task 2. Categories of Performance Measure Maintenance/Update/Computation:

- **Service Point-Based Measures**: Focus on the performance and utilization of specific service points (e.g., a particular doctor, a diagnostic machine).
- **Customer-Based Measures**: Center around the customer's (patient's) experience, including waiting times, total time in the system, and individual service times.
- **System-Wide Measures**: Aggregate metrics that reflect the overall performance of the system, such as total throughput, average queue length, and system utilization.

Task 3. Design of Two Different Systems with Service Points:

**System 1: Airport Check-in**:
- Service Point 1: Self-Service Kiosks for boarding pass and baggage tag printing.
- Service Point 2: Baggage Drop counters.
- Service Point 3: Security Check.
- Service Point 4: Boarding Gates.

**System 2: Supermarket**:
- Service Point 1: Fresh Produce Weighing Stations.
- Service Point 2: Deli Counter.
- Service Point 3: Checkout Counters.
- Service Point 4: Customer Service Desk.

[For diagrams, imagine each service point as a circle, connected by arrows indicating the flow of customers, and queues represented by striped rectangles.]

Task 4. Three-Phase Simulation Main Loop Algorithm (Pseudocode):

initialize_simulation()
schedule_initial_events()

while not end_of_simulation:
    // A-Phase: Advance Time
    current_time = get_time_of_next_event()

    // B-Phase: Execute Bound Events
    for event in get_events_at_current_time():
        execute_B_event(event)

    // C-Phase: Execute Conditional Events
    while true:
        executed = false
        for C_event in all_C_events:
            if condition_for_C_event(C_event):
                execute_C_event(C_event)
                executed = true
        if not executed:
            break

    update_simulation_state()

print_simulation_results()


Task 5. Explanation of Simulator Classes:

- **A-Phase Coding**:
    - Involves advancing the simulation clock to the time of the next scheduled event. It sets the current time context for the B and C phases.
- **Coding B-Events**:
    - B-events are bound events that occur at a specific time. Coding these involves defining actions that change the state of the simulation at these scheduled times, like the arrival of a new customer.
- **Coding C-Events**:
    - C-events are conditional events triggered by specific states or conditions in the simulation, not by the clock. Coding them involves defining the conditions under which these events are triggered and their subsequent impact on the simulation state.
